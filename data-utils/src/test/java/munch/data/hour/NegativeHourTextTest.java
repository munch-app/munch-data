The bowls come with a base of Japanese Rice, Red Brown Rice Mix, or Chopped Romaine.", "The interesting thing to note is that you can choose an Octopus topping for either the Roasted Sesame or Kimchi options.", "Prices are $9 for “Hungry” size and $14 for the “Starving” size.", "I had the Hawaiian Original was recommended, with a tuna and salmon mix. The Hawaiian original boast of a savory shoyu base with that added punch of sesame oil, topped with Asian garnishes like edamame, shitake and chuka salad.", "Here’s what I like about Sweetfish: Bowls are marinated fresh-to-order, which ensures a certain level of freshness. It made that difference. The downside is you got to wait for a moment (and you may just wander to llao llao next door).", "As I took up a spoon of fish, there was an aromatic whiff of sesame oil, which enhanced the eating experience – didn’t feel as boring to eat. The neon-green chuka salad gave the bowl a varying texture and sweet finish.", "I thought the brown rice was on the dry side though.", "Sweetfish Poke stands out in terms of freshness, and some variety. But it probably needs to do something to differentiate with all the other Poke Bowl shops out there, which is fast going to become one too many.", "Sweetfish Poke #B2-30, 13 Stamford Road, Capitol Piazza Singapore 178905 (Cityhall MRT Exit D) Opening Hours: 11.30 am – 8.00pm Daily", "Other Related Entries 10 Poké Bowl Shops In Singapore Poke Doke (Millenia Walk) Alakai Poke (Everton Park) Alter Ego (Esplanade) Pololi (Telok Ayer)", "* Follow @DanielFoodDiary on Facebook and Instagram for more food news, food videos and travel highlights.
